/* Look at the number of likes on line 26. Right now it's hard coded to '100'.
Use a piece of data coming in through props to display the correct number of likes.
You will also add an onClick handler that utilizes `likePost` to increase the count of likes.
(As a stretch goal, you might want to prevent your user from "liking" the same post more than once.) */
